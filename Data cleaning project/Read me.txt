SQL Data Cleaning Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a large dataset containing 56,000+ rows using SQL. The dataset consists of raw, unstructured data that requires cleaning, filtering, and transformation to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability for data analysis.

Features Implemented

The SQL scripts in this project include:

1. Data Selection & Filtering

Extracting relevant columns using SELECT.

Filtering data using WHERE conditions to remove anomalies and unwanted records.

2. Data Transformation & Standardization

Converting data types to ensure consistency.

Using CASE statements to handle NULL values and standardize categorical variables.

3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) & Window Functions

Implementing CTEs to break down complex queries for better readability and performance.

Using Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LAG(), LEAD()) for advanced data transformations and trend analysis.

4. Handling Duplicates & Missing Data

Identifying and removing duplicate records using DISTINCT and ROW_NUMBER().

Filling missing values using COALESCE() and IFNULL() functions.

5. Data Joins & Integration

Performing INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN operations to merge multiple tables.

Creating summary tables for enhanced reporting.

6. Aggregations & Performance Optimization

Using GROUP BY and aggregate functions (SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()) to derive insights.

Indexing strategies and query optimization techniques for handling large datasets efficiently.

Technologies Used

SQL Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server (choose the one used in your project)

Tools: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench

How to Use

Load the dataset into your SQL database.

Execute the SQL scripts sequentially:

01Review the cleaned data and use it for further analysis or reporting.

Expected Outcomes

A cleaned and structured dataset ready for analysis.

Enhanced data quality with reduced redundancy and inconsistency.

Optimized queries for efficient data processing and retrieval.
